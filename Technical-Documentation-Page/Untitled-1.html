                <p>Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules
                and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction
                with other substances.
            </p>
                <p>Some chemical compositions:
                    <code>Nitrogen = N2, Oxygen = O2, Water vapor = H2O, Methane = CH4, </code>
                    these are some chemical compositions that are present in everyday life.
                </p>
                <p> In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.
                    It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.
                    For exemple, chemistry aspects as:
                    <ul class="special">
                        <li><strong>Botany</strong> the plant chemistry.</li>
                        <li><strong>Geology</strong> the formation of igneous rocks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ecology</strong> how atmospheric ozone is formed.</li>
                        <li><strong>cosmochemistry</strong> the properties of the soil on the moon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pharmacology</strong> how medications work.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>The word chemistry comes from a modification of the word alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that
                encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. Alchemy is 
                often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though alchemists were also interested in
                many of the questions of modern chemistry.
            </p>
                <p>The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word <em>al-kīmīā (الكیمیاء)</em>. In origin, 
                the term is borrowed from the Greek <em>χημία or χημεία</em>. This may have Egyptian origins since <em>al-kīmīā</em> is
                derived from the Greek <em>χημία</em>, which is in turn derived from the word Kemet, which is the ancient name
                of Egypt in the Egyptian language. Alternately, <em>al-kīmīā</em> may derive from <em>χημεία</em>, meaning "cast together".

                <p>The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model. Traditional chemistry starts with
                the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of 
                matter. Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination. The 
                interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions 
                between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are 
                studied in a chemistry laboratory.
                    <ul><p class="info">Structures of matter:</p>
                        <li><strong>Solid</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Liquid</strong></li>                    
                        <li><strong>Gas</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Plasma</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware. However glassware 
                is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is 
                done without it.
            </p>
                <p>A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances. 
                The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between
                atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. 
                The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the 
                number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive 
                decay.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are 
                constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.
            </p>
                <p>Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances
                are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions. They can be analyzed 
                using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography. Scientists engaged in chemical 
                research are known as chemists. Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. Several concepts are 
                essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:
                <code>Matter: In chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and 
                is made up of particles. The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest 
                mass, such as the photon. Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.
                </code>
            </p>
                <p>
                <code>Atom: The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus
                surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud. The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons 
                and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged
                electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the 
                positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times 
                that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.
                </code></p>
                <p>
                <code>Element: A chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom, 
                characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms, known as the atomic number 
                and represented by the symbol Z. The mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a 
                nucleus. Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, 
                they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers 
                are known as isotopes. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical 
                element carbon, but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.
                </code>
            </p>
                <p>
                <code>Compound: A compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element. The properties 
                of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements. The standard nomenclature of compounds is 
                set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Organic compounds are named according 
                to the organic nomenclature system. The names for inorganic compounds are created according to the 
                inorganic nomenclature system. When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two 
                classes, the electropositive and the electronegative components. In addition the Chemical Abstracts Service 
                has devised a method to index chemical substances. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable 
                by a number known as its CAS registry number.

                <p>In addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications, chemicals 
                    can exist in several phases. For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase 
                    classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. A phase is 
                    a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, 
                    such as pressure or temperature.
                </p>
                <p>Physical properties, such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. 
                    The phase of matter is defined by the phase transition, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system 
                    goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.

                <p>In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular 
                    or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these 
                    kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances 
                    involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form 
                    of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.
                </p>
                <p>A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; 
                    in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. A reaction is said to be exothermic if 
                    the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of endothermic reactions, the reaction absorbs 
                    heat from the surroundings.
                </p>
                <p>Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the 
                    activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation 
                    energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor {\displaystyle e^{-E/kT}}e^{-E/kT}  – that is the probability 
                    of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence 
                    of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy necessary for a chemical 
                    reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light, electricity or mechanical force in the form of ultrasound.
