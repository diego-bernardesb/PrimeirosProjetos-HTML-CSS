<h2>Who was Freddie:</h2> 
       <p id="tribute-info">Born in Zanzibar, Tanzania, the son of Bomi and Jer Bulsara, the boy started studying piano in Mumbai (India) when he was just seven years old.
        In 1964 Freddie Mercury's family migrated to Middlesex (London). It was at Ealing Technical College and School of Art that the young man started to study graphic design. Graduation took place in 1969.

       <h2>Freddie Mercury's career:</h2>
       <p>Despite having graduated in Design, Freddie has dedicated his entire career to music.
           </p>
           <p>Passionate about music, Freddie showed interest in the piano in his childhood. In addition to musical talent, the singer and composer had some peculiarities that helped him in the vocal part. Mercury had four more teeth (the incisors), legend has it that the width of the mouth helped to potentiate the singer's voice.
            During graduation, the boy started singing in a band called Wreckage. Roger Taylor (1949) and Brain May (1947), in turn, had a band called Smile.
            When the Smile frontman left, Freddie Mercury replaced him and the boys decided to change the name of the ensemble to Queen. The last member to join the group was John Deacon (1951), who joined the group in March 1971.</p>
